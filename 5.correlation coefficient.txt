5.correlation coefficient

"""(i) Algorithm
Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset using a library.
Data Preparation: Extract relevant numerical features from the dataset.
Calculate Correlation: Compute the correlation matrix to see relationships between features.
Display Results: Output the correlation matrix and interpret results."""


# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Step 2: Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)

# Step 3: Calculate the correlation coefficient matrix
correlation_matrix = data.corr()

# Step 4: Display the correlation matrix
print("Correlation Coefficient Matrix:\n", correlation_matrix)


"""(iii) Conclusion
Interpreting the Correlation Matrix:
Positive values close to 1 indicate a strong positive correlation (e.g., petal length and petal width tend to increase together).
Negative values indicate an inverse relationship, although this is less common in the Iris dataset.
Values near 0 suggest no strong linear correlation, as seen in some relationships between sepal and petal dimensions."""
