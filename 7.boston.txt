"""(i) Retrieve the Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset is available from various sources, including Kaggle. This dataset contains information on different features (e.g., crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate) used to predict the median home price in various neighborhoods in Boston. Make sure you have set up Kaggle’s API to download datasets, as mentioned in previous responses."""


# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

# Step 2: Load the Boston Housing dataset
# Uncomment the code below if you're using an online dataset directly
# data = pd.read_csv('boston.csv')

# For demonstration, we use the built-in sklearn Boston dataset
boston = load_boston()
data = pd.DataFrame(boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names)
data['PRICE'] = boston.target  # Add target variable to DataFrame

# Step 3: Inspect the data (optional for verification)
print("First few rows of the dataset:\n", data.head())
print("\nData Description:\n", data.describe())

# Step 4: Define the features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop('PRICE', axis=1)
y = data['PRICE']

# Step 5: Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 6: Initialize and train the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 7: Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 8: Evaluate the model

"""(iii) Conclusion
Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.
R-squared (R²) Score: R² represents how well the independent variables explain the variability of the target variable (home prices). An R² closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
Coefficients: The coefficients indicate the weight each feature (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms) contributes to the home price prediction. Positive coefficients mean that as the feature value increases, so does the predicted price, and vice versa.
By using this Linear Regression model, you can gain insights into which factors most influence home prices in Boston and use the model to make price predictions based on new data. Let me know if you’d like to further refine this model or add additional analyses!"""
