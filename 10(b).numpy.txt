"""(i) Algorithm
Import the NumPy Library: Import NumPy to work with arrays.
Define the Array: Create the array using the given elements.
Slice the Array:
Row-wise Slicing: Extract specific rows by specifying row indices.
Column-wise Slicing: Extract specific columns by specifying column indices.
Print Results: Display the sliced sections of the array."""


# Step 1: Import NumPy library
import numpy as np

# Step 2: Define the input array
array = np.array([
    [2, 7],
    [5, 8],
    [6, 10]
])

# Step 3: Perform row-wise and column-wise slicing
# Row-wise slicing (example: extract the first two rows)
row_slice = array[:2, :]  # Slices rows 0 and 1

# Column-wise slicing (example: extract the first column)
col_slice = array[:, :1]  # Slices only the first column

# Step 4: Print the results
print("Original Array:\n", array)
print("\nRow-wise Slicing (first two rows):\n", row_slice)
print("\nColumn-wise Slicing (first column):\n", col_slice)



"""(iv) Conclusion
Row-wise Slicing: By selecting specific row indices, we can extract certain rows. Here, we extracted the first two rows.
Column-wise Slicing: By specifying column indices, we can extract certain columns. Here, we extracted the first column.
This program demonstrates how to slice a NumPy array to access specific rows and columns, which is useful for isolating parts of the dataset for analysis or further processing."""
